# ENSO-CODE
Detrending and modeling of NOAA precipitation climate data woth a focus on the climate divisions in California. Acquired precipitation data through ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/. This code detrends seasonal data, performs principal component analysis, signal processing with fourier transforms, creates 3d wavelet plots, arima models, and remainder plots with 95% confidence intervals. The resulting plots make searching for, analyzing, and acquiring abnormalities in the data much easier.
